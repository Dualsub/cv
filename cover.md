Hello,

My name is Simon Sjöling, and I'm applying for the Gameplay AI / ML Engineer role. 

I think this role is a perfect fit for me, since it perfectly blends my two biggest interests of: AI/ML, which I have specialized in during my master studies, and game programming, which I have learned by creating tons of projects in Unreal and mostly my custom game engines.

Currently I'm in the process of writing my master thesis about real-time neural soft shadow rendering, i.e. rendering shadows with ML, which will be completed on June 10th.

In my studies I have had dozens of courses involving programming, training and evaluating AI models of all kinds, including reinforcement learning, CNNs for computer vision, transformers, and generative types like GANs and diffusion models. This work has mainly been done in Python using ML frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. I've also had many math courses to get a better understanding of the underlying optimization and statistical theory.

Outside of my studies, I have always been writing game engines in C++. Over the last years I have focused more on writing actual games from scratch rather then core systems and editors, which has resulted in several cool projects, including a top-down shooter with simple state machine based AI using flow field pathfinding, a third-person multiplayer shooter which featured a custom blend tree implementation and navigation mesh pathfinding for AI enemies, and several smaller game jam games with simpler AI. All was built on top of and custom game engine framework with a custom Vulkan renderer.

I'm a very big fan of not only the games, but the technical development and innovation at Embark. I was of coursed amazed with the game AI technology in Arc Raiders that used ML components to create really unique gameplay. From a rendering point of view, I find the use of your own UE branch with DXGI to be really exiting, as many other games converge to the nanite-based rendering pipeline. Moreover, I find the the focus on tooling around the game engine, such as the many open-source Rust project, really cool and exiting. I'd would love to contribute and be a part of these amazing aspects of the work at the studio.

If you were to consider me for this role, I believe that I can bring an ethusiasm for the technology, and a diligent work ethic to the team.

Simon Sjöling
