Hello,

My name is Simon Sjöling, and I'm applying for the Gameplay AI / ML Engineer role. I live in Gothenburg currently and am open to relocating to Stockholm. I'm currently in the process of writing my masters thesis about real-time neural soft shadow rendering(i.e. rendering shadows with ML) which will be completed on June 10.

This role feels like a perfect fit for me, since it perfectly blends my two biggest interests of AI/ML, which I have specialized in during my masters studies, and game programming, which I have learned by creating tons of projects in Unreal and mostly in my custom game engines.

In my studies I have had dozens of courses involving programming, training, evaluating and optimizing AI models of all kinds, including reinforcement learning, CNNs for computer vision, transformers, and generative types like GANs and diffusion models. This work has mainly been done in Python using ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. I've also had many math courses to get a better understanding of the underlying optimization and statistical theory.

Outside of my studies, I have always been writing games in C++. Over the last few years I have focused on building games and prototypes in my own C++ engine, which has resulted in several projects, including a top-down shooter with state machine AI and flow field pathfinding, a third-person multiplayer shooter with a custom blend tree system and NavMesh-based AI navigation. I have also previously built similar projects in Unreal Engine, including enemy AI behavior implementations, which is where I was first introduced to C++ programming, so I’m very familiar with both the editor and the C++ API.

I'm particularly interested in this role since I'm a very big fan of the amazing games, but also of the technical innovation at Embark. The RL based location and animation systems seen in Arc Raider has been really inspiring to read about. I also find the focus on tooling around the game engine, such as the many open-source Rust projects, really cool and exciting, as I also enjoy Rust. I would love to contribute and be a part of these amazing aspects of the work at the studio.

If you were to consider me for this role, I believe I can bring a strong technical breadth across C++, Unreal, and applied ML, along with a lot of enthusiasm and drive for technical innovation in games and a focus on delivering high quality results.

Best regards,
Simon Sjöling
